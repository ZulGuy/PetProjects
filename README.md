# PetProjects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of my personal pet projects. These projects are experimental, educational, and exploratory in nature, serving as a space for learning new technologies, testing ideas, and building small applications for fun and skill development.

## About

Pet projects are personal programming endeavors created outside of professional work. This repository serves as a central location where I:

- Experiment with new programming languages and frameworks
- Practice coding skills and try new techniques
- Build small tools and applications
- Test out interesting ideas and concepts
- Learn and grow as a developer

Feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
